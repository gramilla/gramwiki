# Setting up Docker on Linux Server

Docker is a tool used for creating, deploying, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and efficient, making them an ideal solution for running applications on Linux servers. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to install Docker on a Linux server.

## Step 1: Update your system

Before installing Docker, you should update your system to ensure that all packages are up to date. To do this, run the following commands in your terminal:

sqlCopy code

`sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade` 

## Step 2: Install Docker

To install Docker, you need to add the Docker repository to your system and then install the Docker engine. Run the following commands in your terminal:

csharpCopy code

`sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io` 

## Step 3: Verify installation

Once Docker is installed, you can verify that it's working correctly by running the following command:

Copy code

`sudo docker run hello-world` 

This command will download a small image and run it in a container. If everything is working correctly, you should see a message that says "Hello from Docker!"

## Conclusion

That's it! You've successfully installed Docker on your Linux server. Now you can start deploying your applications in containers and take advantage of the benefits they provide.
